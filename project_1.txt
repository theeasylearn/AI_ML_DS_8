Project Title

Raja Mantri Chor Sipahi Game in Python

Objective

Create a console-based Python program that simulates the traditional Raja Mantri Chor Sipahi game with scoring.

Program Requirements

The program must allow at least 4 players.

The game should randomly assign one role each round:

Raja

Mantri

Chor

Sipahi

Roles must be assigned secretly (players should not see each other’s roles).

The Mantri must guess who the Chor is.

Points must be awarded based on whether the guess is correct or incorrect.

The game should support multiple rounds.

At the end, display the final scoreboard.

Development Steps
Step 1: Player Setup

Ask the user to enter the number of players.

Collect player names and store them.

Validate that there are at least 4 players.

Step 2: Role Assignment

Create a list containing the four roles.

Randomly shuffle and assign one role per player (only four active roles per round).

If more than 4 players, rotate roles each round.

Step 3: Reveal Raja

Identify the player assigned as Raja.

Display a message announcing the Raja.

Step 4: Mantri Guess

Ask the Mantri to guess which player is the Chor.

Take input carefully and validate it.

Step 5: Scoring Logic

Implement scoring rules such as:

Raja: 1000 points

Mantri: 800 points if correct, otherwise 0

Sipahi: 500 points if Chor is caught

Chor: 0 if caught, high points if not caught

Store and update scores using a suitable data structure.

Step 6: Display Results

Reveal all roles after each round.

Show updated scores.

Step 7: Multiple Rounds

Ask whether the players want to continue.

Repeat the process until users choose to stop.

Additional Requirements

Use functions to organize the program.

Use lists and dictionaries where appropriate.

Handle invalid inputs properly.

Make the interface clear and user-friendly.
